**Job Prediction – Data Science Project**

This project is a Data Science–based Job Prediction system that applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict job-related outcomes from structured data.
The trained model is integrated into an interactive Streamlit web application to demonstrate real-world deployment of a Data Science solution.
